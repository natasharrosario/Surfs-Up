# Surfs Up Module Challenge

## Overview

For this module's project, we were tasked with analyzing weather data given to us by an imaginary investor, to address any concerns he may have with investing in our (also imaginary) Surf and Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. To do this, I used SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database, designed a Flask application using the weather data, and wrote/executed Python code in a Jupyter notebook and created graphs using Python.

Additionally, for this challenge, I used Python, Pandas functions, and SQLAlchemy to retrieve temperature statistics for June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results

* The average temperature in Oahu during the month of June was 75 degrees (rounded). 

* The average temperature in Oahu during the month of December was 71 degrees (rounded).


* The minimum temperature during the month of June was 64 degrees, while the maximum temperature was 85 degrees.

* The minimum temperature during the month of December was 56 degrees, while the maximum temperature was 83 degrees.

## Summary

Because the average temperatures in Oahu during both June and December are about the same and generally quite warm, it would be reasonable to conclude that this business would be sustainable year-round. On days where the temperature meets the average or higher, business should be booming. However, it is important to note that on cooler days during both months and throughout the year, it is not likely that a surf and ice cream shop will attract a large clientele. 

Two additional queries that could be useful in order to gather more weather data for these months would be a measure of precipitation levels to see if 1) rainfall might have a negative effect on the shop's business, and 2) which areas have the best weather conditions and would make attractive locations for the shop.
